This project consists of these files:
```

bot.py
config.py [MISSING]

</p>

## Why is the config.py file missing?
This file contains the **BOT TOKEN** and with it inside **IT SHOULDN'T BE SHARED**
In this repo, we provide you with an example configuration that you have to rename to config.py
To run this bot succesfully
## How to run this bot?
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Rename the `` config.py.example `` file to `` config.py `` and add your token
3. Run the main `` bot.py `` file
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```
